  <h1>My Campus Life</h1>

  <p>
   In UTHM, aside from mandatory lectures, i also enroll myself in activities outside of class. Sometimes i go to the stadium to do some exercises like jogging or just brisk walking. I also love to hang out with friends every once in a while. We play sports together and after that we chill at the cafe.

   During final examination week, my friends and I always go to the library to have a study group session.
   Study group is so much fun compared to studying alone. It helps a lot since you will always someone that you can refer to whenever you are having trouble studying. My life in campus is very special because there will be something fun for me to do.
